# Ants
The plan is to create an ant simulator just for my amusement.
The Plan:
    1. Create an empty enviroment;
    2. Create an ant with some basic movement
    3. Give the Ant some attributes that will impact its endurance, hunger, strength...
        1. Ideas:
            1. Strength will allow the Ant to carry more food but require more energy to move around
            2. Endurance ... to burn the food slower but lower its Strength
            3. "Individuality"? ... increase Ant's will to survive, so wont bring so much food to the anthill
            4. Curiosity? To make the Ant wonder off more
        2. Instead of attributes to lower each other, create a separate "meta-attributes" that increase one attribute but decrease another 
    4. Introduce food 
    5. Make the Ant look for food and eat
    6. Ant dies without food :(
    7. Add more Ants and an Anthill
        1. The Ants will spawn ants as they bring food
        2. One of the attributes will determine if the Ant should focus on its own survivability or to bring food to the Anthill
    8. Give them some group behaviour
    9. ...
    10. Profit
Loose ideas:
    1. Plug it into a genetic algorithm to see what comes out
    2. Make 2 separate ant swarms to compete
